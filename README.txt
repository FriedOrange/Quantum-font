Quantum fonts for Quikscript
============================

Version 1.000

These fonts are distributed in two formats: TTF for installation on computers; and WOFF for embedding in Web pages. The source code for generating the fonts is available on Github [1]. The Quikscript characters are mapped to the Unicode Private Use Area, so you’ll need to install a special keyboard layout to type with them. Finally, the fonts are all available under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 [2]. This means they may be freely used, distributed, extended and adapted.

This is a set of pixelated, retro-style fonts based upon the classic 5×7 dot matrix for the Latin capitals. In order to faithfully evoke the bitmapped computer fonts of the past, the dots are placed at strictly *quantum* intervals.

The fonts are proportionally spaced and kerned (except the Print Mono variant, obviously) in order to maximise the legibility of Quikscript and Shavian text. The Latin lower case was designed to match the appearance of the other two alphabets.

There are six variants of Quantum, most with a matching bold style:

- Regular is like most ‘pixel’ fonts that use connected, square dots like the displays of 8-bit home computers and game consoles from the 1980s.

- Print is made up of discrete circular dots, resembling the output of a dot-matrix printer or ‘best before/use by’ stamps on food products.

- Print Mono is more than just a monospaced version of the Print variant: it closely imitates those impact dot-matrix printers that can strike dots at half-intervals along the horizontal axis, allowing for much smoother diagonals and stronger (albeit squarer) curves. The ‘bold’ style is really bold-extended—double the width of the regular—in keeping with the simple auto-generated ‘enhanced’ font provided by many printers.

- Raster is made up of rounded horizontal lines, imitating the *raster* formed by the electron beam in a monochrome CRT monitor, as used by early personal computers.

- Screen has a similar effect to Print, but uses square dots instead. It resembles the light-up LED message panels on motorways, at airports and train stations, as well as the smaller ‘character LCDs’ in many devices.

- Video is essentially an interpolated version of Regular. It resembles the on-screen displays of VCRs, Teletext, camcorders and the like; harking back to the early days of computerisation in television and home video. This variant has no bold style, as the interpolation method has no effect at all on the standard bold designs.
The Quantum family replaces my earlier fonts, QS Matrix 2, QS Matrix 1 and QS Video [3].
